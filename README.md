here we have use some html amd css comand in this shoe page project:
1) first in index.html file we make a div . we make a div by container attribute. We basically make a container and we perform all our operation within this container.
2) If we want to give color to our background then we use the tag background: linear-gradient();and within this we have use three hex color code to give color to our page.
3) to type shoe-1 we use simple h2 tag.
4) for para we use p tag and this p tag come under the div tag.
5) to attach the image of shoes we use the image tag and in src we give the source of our image .
6) In css part we move to give styling to our web page so in style.css
7) In style.css part we first make a universal selector in this selector we make margin and padding=0 and give property as border-size:border-box.
8) for the container div we give some styling as :width, height, position and overflow .
9) for the shoe we set there height and width , give padding ,amrgn, give box shadow.
10) here shoe is getting hover so for this we use the property as hover.
